Smart Navigation System for Visually Impaired People
====================================================
This project focuses on developing a Smart Navigation System to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their environment using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision technologies.

-Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to:
Provide real-time object detection to help visually impaired individuals navigate independently.
Enhance safety by identifying obstacles and guiding users effectively.
Utilize AI models to recognize and classify objects in the environment.

-Project Workflow
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collected image datasets containing various objects and obstacles.
Preprocessed images for better feature extraction.
Split data into training and testing sets.

2. Object Detection
Implemented YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model.
Detected and classified objects such as:
-Vehicles
-Humans
-Obstacles
-Traffic Signals

3. Audio Feedback System
Converted object detection outputs into audio signals.
Used Text-to-Speech (TTS) libraries to provide real-time guidance to users.

4. Model Training and Evaluation
Trained the model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Evaluated model performance using metrics like:
-Accuracy
-Precision
-Recall

5. Real-Time Implementation
Integrated the system with a camera and speaker.
Provided continuous audio feedback to guide the user through the environment.
